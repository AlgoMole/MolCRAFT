Welcome to the official repository for the MolCRAFT series of projects! This series focuses on developing and improving deep learning models for **structure-based drug design (SBDD)** and **molecule optimization (SBMO)**. Our goal is to create molecules with high binding affinity and plausible 3D conformations.

This repository contains the source code for the following projects:

* [**MolCRAFT**: Structure-Based Drug Design in Continuous Parameter Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12141) (ICML'24)
* [**MolJO**: Empower Structure-Based Molecule Optimization with Gradient Guided Bayesian Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13280) (ICML'25)
* [**MolPilot**: Piloting Structure-Based Drug Design via Modality-Specific Optimal Schedule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07286) (ICML'25)

## üìú Overview

The MolCRAFT series addresses critical challenges in generative models for SBDD, including modeling molecular geometries, handling hybrid continuous-discrete spaces, and optimizing molecules against protein targets. Each project introduces novel methodologies and achieves **state-of-the-art** performance on relevant benchmarks.

## üöÄ Projects

### MolCRAFT (Let's Craft the Molecules)

<p align="center"><img src="asset/molcraft.gif" width="60%"></p>

* **Description**: MolCRAFT is the first SBDD model that employs BFN and operates in a **continuous parameter space**. It introduces a novel noise-reduced sampling strategy to generate molecules with superior binding affinity and more stable 3D structures. MolCRAFT has demonstrated its ability to accurately model interatomic interactions, achieving reference-level Vina Scores.
* **Key Contributions**:
    * Operates in continuous parameter space for SBDD within BFN framework.
    * Novel variance reduction sampling strategy that improves both sample quality and efficiency.
    * Achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity and structural stability.

### MolJO (Molecule Joint Optimization)

![](asset/moljo_framework_all.png)

* **Description**: MolJO is a gradient-based SBMO framework that leverages a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference. It facilitates **joint guidance signals across different modalities** (continuous coordinates and discrete atom types) while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. MolJO introduces a novel backward correction strategy for an effective trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
* **Key Contributions**:
    * Gradient-based SBMO framework with joint guidance across different modalities.
    * Backward correction strategy for optimized exploration-exploitation.
    * State-of-the-art performance in practical optimization tasks, including multi-objective and constrained optimization for R-group redesign, scaffold hopping, etc.

### MolPilot (How to Pilot the Aircraft)

![](asset/molpilot_vos.png)

* **Description**: MolPilot addresses challenges in geometric structure modeling by focusing on the **twisted probability path of multi-modalities** (continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies). It proposes a VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy, optimizing the Variational Lower Bound as a path integral for SBDD. MolPilot significantly enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling.
* **Key Contributions**:
    * Addresses multi-modality challenges in SBDD.
    * Introduces VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy, generally applicable to a wide range of frameworks including diffusions.
    * Achieves 95.9% PoseBusters passing rate on CrossDock with significantly improved molecular geometries.
